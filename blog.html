            <h4>1. Difference between var, let and const keywords in JavaScript.</h4>
            <div class="">
                <p>Var is a function Scope veriable declaration but other hand let and const is  block scoped veriable declaration. Hence, Var is a function Scope that is why you can access data from anywhere in the function and also chaange and update the value.</p>
                <p>on the other hand, let and const is a function scoped. So you can not access data from outside of a fuction. And if you use let you can Update the data but in const you can not update or chaange the data.</p>

            <h4>2. what is the benefit of template string?</h4>
            <div class="">
                <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>3. what is the differences between arrow function and regular function?</h4>
            <div class="">
                <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
